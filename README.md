Java script 
The code defines a function called createConfetti() and then immediately calls it:
createConfetti() function:
It uses a for loop to generate 50 individual confetti pieces.
In each loop:
It creates a new <div> element and gives it the class confetti (which would be styled using CSS, likely to define its size, shape, and animation).
It sets a random horizontal position (left) across the viewport width (vw).
It sets a random animation delay (up to 3 seconds) so the confetti falls at different times.
It sets a random bright color using HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness).
It adds the confetti element to the document's body.
createConfetti();:
This line executes the function, making the 50 confetti pieces appear immediately upon script execution/page load.




Html
It uses standard HTML to structure the page and includes a specific feature: a "flip card" element.
The front of the card initially displays the greeting "Happy Teacher's Day!" and a prompt to "Hover to reveal a special message."
The back of the card, which would be visible after some CSS styling and interaction (like hovering), contains a more detailed thank you message to teachers.
In short, it creates a basic webpage with content hidden inside a flip-style element, waiting for CSS to make the "flip" effect work.



Css
Key Styles
body: Sets up the entire page. It uses a pink/orange gradient background and centers the flip card both vertically and horizontally using flexbox. height: 100vh ensures it fills the viewport.
.flip-card: Defines the container for the card, giving it a fixed size (300px by 400px) and a perspective: 1000px to enable the 3D depth effect.
.flip-card-inner: Contains both the front and back of the card.
transition: transform 0.8s makes the flip animation smooth over 0.8 seconds.
transform-style: preserve-3d is crucial for the 3D flip.
.flip-card:hover .flip-card-inner: This is the flip trigger. When you hover over the card, the inner content rotates 180 degrees on the Y-axis.
.flip-card-front, .flip-card-back: Style the two sides of the card.
-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; backface-visibility: hidden; hides the reverse side of an element when it's rotated away from the viewer, preventing the back from showing through the front before the flip.
The front has a red/orange gradient and the back has a blue/teal gradient.
The back is initially rotated rotateY(180deg) so it starts out facing away from the user.
.confetti & @keyframes fall: Creates small, round white elements (.confetti) and animates them to fall from the top to the bottom of the screen (@keyframes fall), creating a falling confetti effect.
In short, it styles a card that flips over when hovered, revealing content on the back side, all against a bright gradient background with endless falling confetti.
